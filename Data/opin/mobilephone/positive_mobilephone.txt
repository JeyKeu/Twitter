@CarmenCrincoli larger than? The Lumia 900 is pretty darn big already :)
@nokia I wished if price for Nokia Lumia 610 could be reduced between $150-$170. I guess it will increase its sale in the global market :)
@jccim Thanks! I silently hoped it was a WP8, but that's great anyways! :) Nokia WP7 devices are great (my lumia 800 is flawless)
@mahmoudbasho Glad you like your Lumia 710 Mahmood! :)

To see someone still using a Nokia 3310. Made me smile!! :-)
@terolahtinen It'll be pure awesomeness soon :) But you are right, the pressure and expectations are building up on #Nokia #Lumia #WP's
@zlatkoe #whiten9 If only it was that easy, there would be no need for Nokia anymore. Though I suspect #Jolla has a plan for that :)
It's a fine day for rowing :D team Nokia are amazing!
I want a new phone :( #nokia

@MohsinHijazee i am seriously thinking to go back to nokia, really. nokia was much more stable than my samsung android :-)
Wow I want the new Nokia Lumia 920. It's YELLOW! Brings out the Thomasian in me! Nonetheless, happy with my Lumia 800 :)
@NokiaUS I would really love a #Nokia #lumia920 that would be amazing I'm loving the #Windows8 specs :)
I was nokia then moved to apple saw android overtaking so to went Galaxy. :-) #myphonestory @danielmarcevans @dxbdiva
@himalkk well if you mean battery life, yes ! :P (I had a Nokia 3120 classic previously, with video calling & all.) :D
Having tweeted that difference between Apple and Android, I'm seriously considering the Nokia Lumia 920 as my next phone :)
Hey Apple you better prepare a billlion dollar because the square with BLUE bezel is patented by Nokia! :P
@nokia @ActiveNick That would be fantastic! Perhaps we'll see that in 2nd gen #wp8 Nokia devices. One can hope! :D #winphan
RT @xxCarstenE: @nokia So the new Iphone5 was unveiled today and i have to say: The #Lumia920 is simply more amazing, has more innovatio ..
So basically Nokia Lumis 920 is technological more advance product. Thank God some hope that Nokia will not die :)

RT @daryldominic: @SoulPunkTZ SONY XPERIA S. I WANT THIS :(
USER Asus Transformer Prime! I have one and I love it.
USER Faster CPU+GPU, like the Samsung Exynos 5250
USER That phone has a slow CPU and GPU compared to the latest phones. It will not run 3D games very well.
USER Yep I got 4G service again in Dallas too!
USER USER my tip is LOOK AT THE CALENDAR ON YOUR PHONE ;-)
USER Normally I would say HTC, unless you want to get the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
USER USER iPhone user here. Purchased a Galaxy Nexus and just used Google wallet for the first time. AWESOME is all I  ...
USER Same here. Galaxy Nexus and double data promo got me to switch. Super happy with everything so far!
USER USER loved the commercial. And this is coming from a HTC fan!
It's official. With his purchase of an iPhone 4S, my father now owns a "better" smartphone than I do.
USER USER my favorite phone name as heard in a TV spot: "The Samsung Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch". Kill me.
iPhone 4S is official, design identical to iPhone 4. A5 CPU as expected.
