@vogueoz It's a bummer that near all comps. Have iPhone prizes. :( as not everyone liked iPhones. I prefer HTC. Better for business :)
@shamamajor shut up haha I love my HTC :D better than your silly iPhone which you clearly don't pay your bill for cheapskate :p
I neeeeddddd a white Iphone 4 now! I hate my HTC. Who would donate $100 to get Alexis an iPhone foundation?? :)
Might just take my iPhone back, I forgot how amazing it was :( 'My HTC was also excellent but for school, Apple wins :)
@Lowriiiiii @stacieskym its easy on HTC go to edit profile and upload! But its obv not tha simple..good luck! :) esp with u 2 haha!
@yakiyakichan Nooo, I like and have HTC phone, not Samsung. I like Taiwan and Japan phones. I want this from Japan! :)
No longer part of IPhone Team.. Jumped on the HTC instead :-)
Can not wait for the new iphone. I can't deal with this damn HTC anymore :(
#HTC and #Samsung are so gonna sue #Apples for that taking pictures while recording feature! :D !!
I want the HTC One-X. Fuck that iPhone 5 . :D
The new Apple i-phone looks wonderful! But I will stick with my HTC Desire HD :)
@_tokerd I like the S3 but my husband's Samsung has been nothing but trouble. My HTC has fared much better so I guess I'll stick with it. :
@RizzyRogers lol I wish I still had android I miss my HTC, it's my bf fault :-( w/this team iPhone shit
@__Beav the thing I love about my HTC is how solid it I can drop it and not worry :) #quality. iPhone screens are horrific :(
@daniel_ley urm I have a htc desire hd! Quite good but want an iPhone back cus mine went down the loo :(
I was expecting much more from the Apple iPhone 5. HTC is the greatest innovator from now. HTC One the best. Miss you Steve Jobs. :(
@callumsaunders I loved my HTC One X, made it all round travels... then fell out of tank bag of Honda on roundabout :-( Still, excuse for 4
@ThrillMeDead I'm an HTC lover, but S3 is by far more superior! :)
@eggynewydd HTC Desire C is tiny and has a decent camera. I’m using a HTC One X these days but it isn’t exactly compact :)
@c4ptainjack i never really liked my htc with android :( love my iphone now!
@untitled_fear really! Wow thats awesome! Lets see what happens! Abhi i m happy with htc but i miss using iphone too! Lol :P

Cannot wait to have money to send my htc off to be fixed. Fucking hate this shitty blackberry :(
@htc I love listening to music a lot on my HTC but the battery doesn't feel the same way... :(
@htc ics would be good rite about now, but the incredible 2 is lacking :(
I need a new cellphone asap. Apparently my htc can't handle swimming and bungee jumping courses :(
@saaalome1 naww :( blackberrys sucks right? hahah ive got a htc wildfire but i want i new one hahah
Today I checked out HTC One X. Awesome phone but too costly. :( The good news is that there is a system "beats audio".
@ItsShannaaa I want a blackberry, i ain't about dat IPHONE life. :D seriously.
@lilgian1 Cause on Blackberry it's a hug :) But since you ditched for an iPhone it looks like a vagina :( #TextingProblems
