@gilescolborne pretty nifty cameras on these iPhones. Which is lucky as I lost my little Olympus in France :(
@tconlan25 just realised you didn't take the Olympus with you :(
@The_No_Show You would think, wouldn't you? It's an Olympus LS-5. Recording in MP3 but my MacBook refuses to see it. USB or no :(
@mhinganzima I miss my records. Also, that awesome Olympus Stylus camera was stolen :( sank you!
@shawnab6 crap, I just went to go to the link and it said it was sold out :( it was an Olympus Tough digital camera for $149 rather $300

@TheBoyandMe I've only got an iPhone 4S :-( and a great Olympus camera which was never as good as my old Kodak
This is the reason I haven't made a video in three weeks. I hate my little crappy Olympus :( but; may make one after Apocalypse anyway...
@lakbaydiva nice pictures indeed. $400 is ok. my olympus then wasn't that great. ok at widest angle but you can't control aperture :(
@PanchLokS lol I wanted to bring my Olympus but the batteries were dead :(
Stingy Olympus! They gave me such a short camera strap! :(
@thebloodywriter film is expensive :( I'd lend you my Olympus OM-10 but my sisters borrowing it currently.

Doing photography for cousins wedding and the lens I wanted to use is broken :( Any tips for getting the most out of a Canon 18-55 kit lens
Why did the Canon G1 X have to suck so much on close up photos? Brilliant camera otherwise. Not good Canon. You make good cameras usually :
Really upset, was hoping I'd take good pics here in Amman but was surprised to find my cam not working. Now gotta look for a canon shop :(
@CoffeeGeek if i sold my Triathlon bike + all my Canon L lenses + the camera I would still be a little short for the Leica :(
Good news is that they can fix the flash.. The bad news is that shipping of the part from Canon takes 7-10 business days. :(
@ShannonPurcell Yeh actually I've a Canon 50D but I fucking hate it and regret not getting the Nikon D90 that I was originally gettin :(
Failed at my canon. :( She blamed the storm for delayed shipments. I guess another week won't kill me...

@Nikon Very :( with the new D600. No iris adjust in video mode, no histogram in video mode. This is a deal breaker. Looking at GH3 now.
Nikon Or Canon?! But Nikon expensive sia! :(
Total panic and misery is setting in as I realise I appear to have lost a rather expensive Nikon D3000?!! :-(
@filipinaf0rever oh we'll tru, but I wanna save up for a Nikon since I'm a dumb butt for losing it sike I don't have that money :(
Dear @Nikon_Photo: Please stop making red DSLR cameras :( They do not look good!  Sincerely :)

@xander85 The White Nikon 1 J1 on tvsn is gone now. :(
Oh, @NikonUSA, I want to buy Nikon but a $650 difference between comparable set-ups means I'll be going Canon :(
I guess I'll never own a Leica M, but a Nikon full-frame would suffice. :(
Want a Nikon DLSR that records, my Nikon D40 doesn't :(
I cannot believe that my dad didn't want to buy the camera i want : (
@TLangworth It's a lens error so I suppose I should send it to Canon and see. It was a gift and a really good camera so it's a bit sad. :(
@pausethemoment Actually, my Canon is broken. Think it got too wet...  :-(  But the iphone has been working out ok.
