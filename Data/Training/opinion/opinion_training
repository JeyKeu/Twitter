This phone is twice as loud as my previous phone, the HTC. Loud in a good way though :)
Side effect of #WP8 - people asking me abut my @htc #HD7 running #WP7, realize "it's not that bad". Been saying that for 2+ years :-)
@lookitskris I'd certainly recommend playing with one.. I didn't think HTC could make a handset so swish :)

So finally after a lot of research and giving a lot of thought, Htc one X + it is....  Dropped the idea of Samsung s3. :-)
And boom ! The first place for the best display for a smartphone is still under the One X :D
I want to get the HTC Vivid. That might be in my possession soon :)
The HTC ONE X have the most beautiful speaker that ever existed in a phone, now that HTC's Droid DNA is out, it's looks even better :D

@zblomstrom Lol the HTC phone is on Ice Cream Sandwich too. That's why they were my faves :P US Cellular sucks. #Sprint all the way!
@sahudkins That's an iphone 4 camera. But the HDR setting has been turned on. I also have an HTC one X that does the same thing. :D

Losing your phone is like losing your life! Especially if it's a Nokia :D @NokiaPakistan

@BellaAlubo oh ok thanks :) .. the nokia I use is cheap as hell it can't do nothing but text, call n watsapp..lol
Instead of buying Nokia phone only for 3d maps, ill go with high end GPS device :D  RT @rutuv: Nokia acquires 3D-mapping company Earthmine,
Oh yeah Nokia map coming to Android :)
@AT1ST haha yeah I figured as much, but had to make sure :D I wonder if Nokia maps will arrive before Google Maps.
