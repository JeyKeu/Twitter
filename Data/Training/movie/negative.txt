Soooo, not going to see Skyfall tonight. Just too damn tired. :(
Saw #skyfall last nite - WORST Bond film ever... In fact the ONLY bad Bond film!!! So disappointed - No wonder they r 'hyping' it up ! :-(
@weaksauce12 I was disappointed with Skyfall :( Perhaps, save it for Zero Dark Thirty or the Hobbit lol
#skyfall #007 = beyond disappointed. Seems we are returning to the bad old days of punning and plot holes :(
I shed a tear watching Breaking Dawn pt 2. Fucking sick way to end the twilight saga :D
Tics for the twilight saga movie marathon is all sold out :( I mean come on give me a chance I've never watch anything twilight before
This sucks!! Usually for The Twilight saga movies, i always watch the day it comes out but today, NO!!! :( I am so sad today bcoz of my mum
Just got home from watching "jab tak hai jaan" movie wasn't quite as good as i hoped. Not yash raj style. Too predictable :(
Waited a whole year for Jab tak hai jaan. Actually so disappointed :(
Watched Jab Tak Hai Jaan 3 days ago and Im a bit disappointed. Veer-Zaara was way better. Movie lacked lots of things :( @Iestegaar
Just saw Jab Tak Hai Jaan. I know it's Yashji's last film, but it was just not good, sorry to say :(

#TheHealing opens todaaaay! But I can't watch. Same as I can't watch The Avengers, The Amazing Spider-Man, and The Dark Knight Rises. :(
So apparently Candice can't read a calendar which means no popcorn time and no Argo :-(
Bro is so desperate to watch Argo that he booked us the first row of the theatre. I dislike first rows. :(
@RJalias Awww, looks like I won't be watching Argo, it's not in theaters anymore here! :(
@Christina_J1210 saw Argo, but Lincoln is at a theater I don't like going to because the chairs are uncomfortable :(
@RaynugaDewi went to watch life of pi and couldnt evn understnd the stry :(
Finally saw Skyfall... Literally gutted... Why do that to the car? :-(
Better late than never seeing skyfall but @JakeJones1994 was falling asleep :(
@Jack_Ginge I'm pretty sure it is I'm afraid :/ well that's a disappointment :( skyfall this weekend it is then, it better be good!!
