@lokcheung Lok I've been wanting to use my old olympus OM lenses on my dslr, what adapter do you use? I love your videos btw :)

@KFTUPhotography I have an Olympus, which have Zeiss lenses and are brilliant, underrated in Canon v. Nikon wars, but I totally recommend :

@JurgenTE Fujifilm positions their goods as premium products. And I like that very much. :)
USER yes, the canon t3i is a very good camera. equal to the t2i by the way - so you'd save ~$60.
USER i like canon, and use the 7D. if you're starting out, the t2i is a good deal.
USER You should try the new D7000. I think you'll love it!
USER Try the 35mm f1.8 DX lens at your local vendor. The bokeh is amazing and it comes at a very good price #nikon
USER check out the 35mm 1.8 lens. Great quality at a very low price.
USER I also just got a new USER digital camera! It's a red Nikon L110 go check it out, it's actually beautiful!!!

So happy for two very talented friends who have both got back into Leica shooting with an M9 and an M-E :-) Roll on beautiful images!!
@JustJoshinYu Well, I actually learned that Leica is considered more so outside the studio shooting crowd :)
@scattereddimag Had no idea what a Leica was when i started shooting with an M6. A friend lent it to me for a few months  I loved it :)
@feeniks can you just perhaps give him my address instead? I will be happy with the leica :-)
@SonyAlphaLab lucky you ! But I received an old Leica Digilux 1 as a gift from my wife yesterday ! Haha GOOD ! :-)
I still dream of buying a Leica Camera :P
