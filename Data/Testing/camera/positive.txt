I love Canon cams. I just think that if you’re gonna call yourself creative that you at least have an open mind about other choices :)
Last days to enter in our Christmas giveaway, don't miss the chance to win two Canon Lenses! :D
@SkaggsBrian @BicyclingMag These were good old digital :) Canon 7D with a 16-35/2.8 and a 70-200/2.8.
@MYCH3MICALJ3SS pft the camera could be better :( ooooh, how much are they?  the Canon I've got now is really good
@KeatonStromberg wow I'm done with you. I love photography too I want the canon rebel t3i :(
@PentaxMalaysia like the d800e right? D7000 which is DX is good enough for me :) know anywhere I can get a pentax to nikon lens mount?
fallen for #lomography looking forward to giving it a shot with my new little Pentax camera :D
@siraqil I don't, unfortunately. Hope you find something good! The D7000 is similar to the Pentax K5, so I'm sure it'll be fine :)
I really need to score an old Asahi Pentax K1000 in good, shootable condition one day… it's part of my Photographer's story :)
I want the Pentax k-30 digital slr if anyone would be soo kind. :D
@youcallmechloe i agree with you on that one, though you should try canon EOS 7D, it's really awesome :)
new camera this christmas . #slr #canon :)
@blazeotokpa I just want Canon Camera to be snapping pishure.............. :D
@TheKatGuev my sister's using LX5, and I like it better than my Canon G12 :)

Excited to have my Canon. :D
So far what sounds like canon is my favorite :)
I miss my canon cams so much already. :( #cameralove
@neonlilith Your Canon looks also nice :D and also expensive here :( over 12000. Oh god. Even a one of them (Nikon or Canon) cost more than
Canon D650, Canon Powershot G15 and S50, Canon Eos M! That's all I want for Christmas! NEW CAMERAS! HUHUHU! T.T It breaks my heart. :-( &lt
YAY!  My new Tamron 17-50mm lens came in!  The nice man even gave me a free UV filter.  Looks like I may be doing photo stuff again soon :)
@PentaxMalaysia I was more attracted to a d7000 bcuz of great low light :) haha still cheaper then a used K5. Wat do u tink of pentax zooms
Mummy got my Nikon this weekend, ugh love her ♥ :)
@itsjennnbitch Niiice :) everybody loves a Nikon!
