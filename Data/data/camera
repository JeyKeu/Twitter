@stephenanberlin Best gift I've ever received was my Pentax K1000 when I was 17. I started crying and didn't stop for 10 minutes :)
@nanawhdir Hmm i didnt ask him :D what is wrong with the nikon and pentax??
@mikeindustries ok great, thanks :)  I'm tempted by the Pentax K-30 and all that entails, but micro-four-thirds is very interesting...
Pentax film camera. The quality on this is so amazing. No makeup either, I have small eyes w/ eyeliner :P http://t.co/oixpp3oE
@otterboi I have stuff uploaded from the Pentax :D
My pentax started magically working! I thought it was broken forever :D
Just received my Asahi Pentax Super-Takumar lens! I'm very satisfied with it! Time to get snapping! :)
Pop up Flash for Pentax Q10 sumpah comel! :D
And yes...that photo of a Pentax was taken with a Pentax.  I love Pentax :)
@AikSaath I'm a pentax camera demonstrator! :D I promote Pentax products.
If someone would like to buy me this I would very much appreciate it :) &lt;3  http://t.co/FEtxce28
@jasonwardcross ohh amazing! I love Pentax I've got a Kr dslr but nothin beats analog! Defo gona wack out the film cameras over crimbo! :)
@KaraAmyLeigh Although the test shots with the Pentax were very good considering its a kit lens, but D7000 it is :) x

@LaBaronneC un Leica ou les dr Rivington Noir/camouflage :)
@diversionary I guess the Leica isn't exactly a beginner's camera, but for $8k, they should throw in some AF action. :p
