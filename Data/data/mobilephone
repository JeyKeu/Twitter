@jccim Thanks! I silently hoped it was a WP8, but that's great anyways! :) Nokia WP7 devices are great (my lumia 800 is flawless)
Jk! Don't want an iPhone, just bought a Nokia Lumia 710 :D
@tamse7 Hey there, what else do you like about the Lumia 900? :)
@mahmoudbasho Glad you like your Lumia 710 Mahmood! :)

@RookieKE No no, Apple Store vs. Windows Phone Marketplace #Lumia @MediaMK :-)
@RookieKE @MediaMK Then get a Nokia Lumia in Cyan, looks great, priced above the Wananchi and its rare to see one in the flesh :-)
New #Nokia Lumia 800 in the house! :-)

Other than old Java, #Asha devices by Nokia are badly underestimated. These are fast and capable phones. :)

USER USER "Awesome phone; Zombie-esque pitch people in suits."
USER Asus Transformer Prime! I have one and I love it.
USER Faster CPU+GPU, like the Samsung Exynos 5250
USER I think we will see some Android devices with 1.5-2GB RAM next week at MWC
USER That phone has a slow CPU and GPU compared to the latest phones. It will not run 3D games very well.
USER Yep I got 4G service again in Dallas too!
USER USER my tip is LOOK AT THE CALENDAR ON YOUR PHONE ;-)
USER Yes I think we will eventually see a Note II, but not until after the Galaxy S III.
.@Ps3y3Ops Upcoming Snapdragon S4 phones include HTC One S, Asus Padfone, Huawei Ascend P1 LTE
USER Are you looking for an Android device with a 5+ inch screen? LG and Panasonic also have upcoming devices with huge screens
USER Cool enjoy your iPhone. Apple handles all the updates so I think you will like that.
USER USER Is it true that once we get to Android 12.0 Apple Pie, that iOS and Android will merge?
USER Any new promotions for Android phones this month? Working on our buyers' guide and don't see anything on your site
USER Samsung said updates will start in March, but it depends on your country and carrier
USER Good question. My guess is Sense 3.x since HTC has yet to really announce Sense 4.0.
Good morning Android nation! Who's ready for the weekend? We'll be here all day so tweet us your Android related questions and tips :)
USER We use the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Which carrier do you have?
USER Galaxy Nexus will likely provide the best user experience til next Christmas. I think it's a safe upgrade.
USER Normally when you install a ROM that doesn't come from your carrier, it could break future OTA updates
Soo many questions about the Sprint Nexus S 4G update to 4.0. When we hear confirmation it's out we will let you know. Tell us if you see it
USER Yeah I don't think TMo will support it anymore. I'd check out the MoDaCo forums for updates on G2x 4.0 ROMs
USER Samsung Galaxy S II! Are you T-Mobile US or UK?
USER They shouldn't even call that product Galaxy Tab 2. Too confusing.
USER Exynos 5250 no doubt. ARM Cortex-A15 CPU core &gt; Cortex-A9
USER Get Google's Galaxy Nexus if you want software updates from Google
USER Latest tablet is Galaxy Note 10.1. The real successor the Tab 10.1 is supposed to be the Tab 11.6. No word on release date
USER Normally I would say HTC, unless you want to get the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
USER USER iPhone user here. Purchased a Galaxy Nexus and just used Google wallet for the first time. AWESOME is all I  ...
USER not at all. The EVO is still Sprint's flagship brand. If you are looking at other phones, they also have the Galaxy Nexus coming up
USER I think it's based more on large displays and fast networks speeds. HTC Ville should have 4.3 inch display and integrated LTE modem
USER I think the next Sprint EVO will be the similar to the HTC Ville that we expect to see announced later this month.
USER Yeah that's possible. The LG X3 could turn into the Revolution 2 when it hits the US.
USER We expect to see the HTC Edge (quad-core), HTC Ville (super thin), new HTC tablet, and new HTC budget phone
USER Don't think so. If you want NFC then you might consider the international version of the Galaxy Nexus that works on T-Mobile
USER Same here. Galaxy Nexus and double data promo got me to switch. Super happy with everything so far!
USER USER Honestly, I would get a Galaxy Note if it were for Sprint and had Sprint's upcoming LTE.
Tweet us your reactions to the Samsung Galaxy Note ad. Best ones will be retweeted so we can share them with everyone. #votefornote
USER USER is that a Galaxy Note in your pocket or are you happy to see me?? #galaxynote
USER USER loved the commercial. And this is coming from a HTC fan!
USER USER they wasted money. They didn't even make sure that people got that the commercial was ripping the iPhone.
USER USER Samsung Galaxy Note. The smartphone for basketball players or the tablet for midgets.
USER Just saw it's not supported on my Galaxy Nexus :(
For those asking, the LG Spectrum has Google search preloaded. It is de-BINGed.
Any questions you guys have about the LG Spectrum?
Sprint just sent us an email that their page is wrong, and that their version of the Nexus will have 32GB of onboard storage. Woot!
The Pantech Burst, Samsung Exhilarate, and 8.2" honeycomb tablet Pantech element will round out the LTE Android offerings.
And there it is... Samsung Galaxy Note coming to AT&T.
And there it is... Samsung Galaxy Note coming to AT&T.
4.65" SAMOLED Skyrocket HD. Another Galaxy S II device on AT&T
Sony Xperia Ion, Sony's first LTE device. Has a 12 megapixel camera, 4.6" display.
AT&T launches 6 new devices, all LTE
As expected, LG is launching the LG Spectrum, as well as their Google TV unit. Now they're onto Smart Appliances.
The boys are up and ready to face the day. Checking out LG, Samsung, NVIDIA, and Texas Instruments press events starting soon.
USER Galaxy Nexus release :) #whatayear
Verizon Galaxy Nexus off-contract pricing is $649. Online sales will start after midnight.
Ok fess up, how many of you called your local USER store today and asked them about the Galaxy Nexus release date?
So y'all still think the USER Galaxy Nexus is coming tomorrow? We are thinking that's a big NOPE.
USER That would put the Galaxy Nexus in what, 2024?
USER USER  I created a twitter hack that changes the words "Galaxy Nexus" to "Duke Nukem Forever" on my twitter feed.
USER They did cancel the Nexus One months after announcing support for it lol...
USER Is The Knight World coming to Android?
USER Any update on Homerun Battle 2 for Android? :)
USER No Android love for Six Guns?
USER USER USER Yeah we just provided a Galaxy S II to an iPhone dev and will hopefully post his responses
Having Verizon iPhone 4S issues; restore with iTunes; phone boots back up; iTunes reads, "Congratulations your iPhone is unlocked." Thanks?
USER Forget "real" 4G and "fake" 4G, how confusing is it to sell a 4G LTE phone with no 4G LTE network? At least it's unlimited ...
Friend is selling Verizon Galaxy Nexus. No box. Comes with 2 Samsung-branded 2,100mAh extended life batteries. $440. Any takers?
USER If I were Apple, my attitude would be: "The iPhone is available on (almost) every network. Be d-bags at your own peril."
The plethora of editing options in iPhoto for iOS is nauseating.
Need another iOS 5.1 beta today, Apple.
USER Obvious question -- When is Samsung announcing the "Galaxy Far Far Away?"
It's official. With his purchase of an iPhone 4S, my father now owns a "better" smartphone than I do.
USER We're working hard on Sparrow iOS.
Verizon Galaxy Nexus Watch: Week 4
Come on Apple.  I know you want to release another iOS beta today.
USER where is the updated iOS app?
USER The Samsung Galaxy S III Epic 4G Touch Captivate Fascinate
USER USER my favorite phone name as heard in a TV spot: "The Samsung Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch". Kill me.
USER Did you use Find My iPhone?
USER No rumors on the next iPhone are worth paying attention to, yet at least. Likely a Fall release, that's about all is known.
USER Not easily, but jailbreaks for iOS 5.1 on iPhone 4S are actively being worked on
USER No rumors on the next iPhone are worth paying attention to, yet at least. Likely a Fall release, that's about all is known.
USER interesting idea, but I haven't seen anything like it. Always sign up for Find My iPhone though!
USER Apple sold 315 million iOS devices -- iPod Touch, iPad, iPhone -- through last year, 62 million in Q4 2011.
USER USER Broadcast the iPhone’s Camera Live to an Apple TV with AirPlay goo.gl/fb/c5GPB #fb
USER USER  I used icloud "find a phone " feature and tracked a thief to his house and recovered my stolen iphone 4s wit ...
USER USER won't happen anytime soon at least, it's the primary  distinction and marketing message for the iPhone 4S
Apple.com is showing iPhone 4S and standard homepage, Steve Jobs memorial link moved to bottom
Scalping of iPhone 4S has begun, only problem is they aren't sold out at Apple Stores yet. Don't pay more than you have to.
USER we're going to direct iPhone 4S users to you and your email address
AAPL up 11.5 points (2.8%) today #iPhone4S” - AAPL is up $50 on the week, or 13.7%
USER iPhone4S launch day, Apple retail will run dedicated Macs with Windows to access Sprints database/ activation center. M ...
iPhone 4S is official, design identical to iPhone 4. A5 CPU as expected.
If there is no iPhone 5 announcement, I am going to get my Galaxy S II.” hearing this sentiment a lot
USER how about buying everyone an iPhone 5?
USER iPhone 5 is very unlikely, just the 4S. iOS 5 GM, iCloud and OS X 10.7.2 will probably come out or get release dates
iPhone 5 to be released October 10th
Sizes will be 16GB, 32GB, & 64GB. 3GS will be 8GB for free. iPhone 4 will be 8GB $99.
iPhone 4S, Same design, A5 chip, 2x faster, dual core...
iPhone 4s is CDMA & GSM, 8MP Camera, 3264x2448, 1/3 faster camera.
