The Dark Knight Rises: a competently produced, two hour and forty-five minute shrug.
I liked the Dark Knight over the Dark Knight Rises, but that's cuz of the villain
I need to see The Dark Knight Rises again. I am so confused. It was so good though. Anne Hathaway completely stole the show.
I have some thoughts about The Dark Knight Rises. I think I've avoided spoilers.

I'm kinda shocked at how much Daniel Craig has aged in just 6 years :( Casino Royale vs Skyfall: http://t.co/vSK5wtI4 http://t.co/sYilWCwV
I am absolutely gutted that I  couldn't make it down (IN TIME) for the Aston Martin VIP screening of Skyfall in Mayfair London tonite : (
Watching Skyfall and then finding out that the T fell off the track today.. stay safe, citizens : (
so my entire family has gone to watch The Hobbit and Skyfall and i'm just sitting here studying for bio :( #winterbreakcomesooner
Daughter's look today was excellent. Her own description: a female version of 'Q' from the movie Skyfall. Didn't take a pic though. :(
Shit. Looks like Wreck-It Ralph is probably no longer in theaters. :( Well at least I'll have Skyfall and The… http://t.co/BPaVetPc
@LukeLogannn hahaha. skyfall was intense too! my first james bond film ever + i basically shit myself. so stressful :-(
Skyfall : ( (@ Cineplex Odeon Gardiners Road Cinemas) http://t.co/5h5mrP2E
@deeky_doo my mate told me about that years ago. I loved that theory and was genuinely annoyed at Skyfall for putting the kabosh on it :(
keep seeing skyfall tweets &amp; I still haven't seen my man in it :( #sojealous #onedayilseeit
I still haven't seen skyfall :(
Want skyfall on DVD :( #lovebond
